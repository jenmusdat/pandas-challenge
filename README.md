For this homework we were given data from a school district looking at students by grade in high schools.  The data provided information about the following:

   * school budgets
   * spending per student
   * student names
   * reading and math scores for each of the students
   * type of school
   * number of students
    
With this data I was able to return information about which schools were more successful in reading and math than other schools. Often we think that if a school has a greater budget the students will be more successful. What this data returned was the opposite. The smaller budget per student school has better score in both math and reading. When looking at the type of shcool and size of school the data returned what science has said for years. The smaller the school, the better the score and charter schools were more successful than distric school in this regard as well. What is intersting to note though is that the medium sized schools and the small school both fared about the same in the scores. Only when you start looking at the larger school districts are the scores different. Reading Scores at all schools were slightly better than math scores. It was interesting to see that some of my hypotheses going into the homework were correct and some were not.

This homework assignment was very helpful to solidify the concepts we previously learned. I feel like I have a firmer graps of the concepts we have learned thus far. Collaborating with my tutor and other students has been incredibly helpful.
